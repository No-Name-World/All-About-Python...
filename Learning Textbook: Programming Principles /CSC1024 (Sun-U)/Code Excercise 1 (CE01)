• The momentum is its mass multiplied by its velocity. 
• The kinetic energy is: (1/2)mv2. 


5. Write a program that prompts the user to input the elapsed time for an event in seconds. The program then outputs the elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds. For example, if the elapsed time is 9630 seconds, then the output would be 2:40:30.
